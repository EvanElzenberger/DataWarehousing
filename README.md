[README.txt](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20848265/README.txt)# Data Warehousing & Vizualization

## Course Description:
Main components of a data warehouse (DW) for business intelligence applications. The course covers topics such as data modeling, combining data from different sources, and developing management reports. Students will learn how to plan, design, and build a DW, as well as analyze data and create reports and dashboards within the DW environment.

## Skills Learned:
- Plan, Design, and Model the Data Warehouse (DW)
  - Utilized various software tools such as Visual Studio, Visio, Word, and Excel to create effective data models for business intelligence purposes.

- Build the Data Warehouse (DW)
  - Utilized Visual Studio (VS) and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to implement the necessary structures and components of a data warehouse.

- Develop a Running Application for Data Import, Database Search, and Table Manipulation:
  - Successfully created a running application that enables the import of new data into the data warehouse. The application also includes functionality for performing database searches with filters and the ability to sort tables generated within the data warehouse. Implemented this functionality using appropriate programming languages and frameworks, ensuring a user-friendly interface and efficient data manipulation capabilities.

- Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) the Data Warehouse (DW)
  - Acquired the skills to extract data from an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) environment and transform it into an appropriate format for loading into the data warehouse. Effectively used Visual Studio (VS) and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to carry out the ETL process.

- Develop Tabular and Multidimensional Analysis from the Data Warehouse (DW)
  - Learned how to perform tabular and multidimensional analysis on the data stored in the data warehouse. Utilized tools such as Visual Studio (VS), Excel, and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to analyze and explore data from different perspectives.

- Create Reports and Dashboards from the Data Warehouse (DW)
  - Developed the necessary skills to construct meaningful reports and interactive dashboards within the data warehouse environment. Utilized Visual Studio (VS) and Microsoft Power BI to create visually appealing and insightful reports and dashboards.

## Software:
- VS: [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)
  - Comprehensive development environment for data modeling, building the data warehouse, analysis, and reporting.
- SSMS: [SQL Server Management Studio](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver16)
  - Database management and administration tool for the SQL Server used in the data warehouse.
- SSIS: [SQL Server Integration Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/integration-services/sql-server-integration-services?view=sql-server-ver16)
  - ETL platform for extracting, transforming, and loading data into the data warehouse.
- Excel: [Microsoft Excel](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/excel)
  - Data analysis tool supporting tabular and multidimensional analysis of data in the data warehouse.
- SSAS: [SQL Server Analysis Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/analysis-services/ssas-overview?view=asallproducts-allversions)
  - Enables multidimensional analysis and exploration of data in the data warehouse.
- Power BI: [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/)
  - Creation of reports and interactive dashboards with powerful visualization and data exploration capabilities.
