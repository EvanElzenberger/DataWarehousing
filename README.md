# Data Warehousing & Vizualization

## Course Description:
Main components of a data warehouse (DW) for business intelligence applications. The course covers topics such as data modeling, combining data from different sources, and developing management reports. Students will learn how to plan, design, and build a DW, as well as analyze data and create reports and dashboards within the DW environment.

## Objectives Completed:
- Plan, Design, and Model the Data Warehouse (DW): In this course, students have successfully learned how to plan, design, and model a data warehouse. They have utilized various software tools such as Visual Studio, Visio, Word, and Excel to create effective data models for business intelligence purposes.Plan, Design, and Model the DW (using VS, Visio, Word, and Excel)
- Build the Data Warehouse (DW): Students have gained proficiency in building a data warehouse. They have utilized Visual Studio (VS) and SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) to implement the necessary structures and components of a data warehouse.
-Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) the Data Warehouse (DW): Students have acquired the skills to extract data from an Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) environment and transform it into an appropriate format for loading into the data warehouse. They have effectively used Visual Studio (VS) and SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to carry out the ETL process.
- Develop Tabular and Multidimensional Analysis from the Data Warehouse (DW): Students have learned how to perform tabular and multidimensional analysis on the data stored in the data warehouse. By utilizing tools such as Visual Studio (VS), Excel, and SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS), they have gained the ability to analyze and explore data from different perspectives.
- Create Reports and Dashboards from the Data Warehouse (DW): Students have developed the necessary skills to construct meaningful reports and interactive dashboards within the data warehouse environment. They have utilized Visual Studio (VS) and Microsoft Power BI to create visually appealing and insightful reports and dashboards.
